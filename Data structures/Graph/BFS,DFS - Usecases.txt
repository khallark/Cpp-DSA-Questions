BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) are two fundamental graph traversal algorithms, each suited for different types of problems. Here's a breakdown of when to use BFS versus DFS:


[WHEN TO USE BFS]:
    - Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs:
    Example: Finding the shortest path in a maze or grid where each move has equal cost.
    Reason: BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.

    - Level Order Traversal:
    Example: Traversing a binary tree level by level.
    Reason: BFS naturally traverses the graph level by level, making it ideal for level order traversal.

    - Minimum Moves/Steps Problems:
    Example: Snakes and Ladders, Knight's shortest path on a chessboard.
    Reason: BFS ensures that the first time you reach a node, it is via the shortest path.

    - Connected Components in Undirected Graphs:
    Example: Finding all connected components in an undirected graph.
    Reason: BFS can explore all nodes connected to a starting node efficiently.

    - Cycle Detection in Undirected Graphs:
    Example: Checking if an undirected graph contains a cycle.
    Reason: BFS can be used with parent tracking to detect cycles in undirected graphs.

    - Bipartite Graph Check:
    Example: Determining if a graph is bipartite (can be colored with two colors without adjacent nodes sharing the same color).
    Reason: BFS helps in alternating coloring while ensuring no two adjacent nodes share the same color.


[WHEN TO USE DFS]:
    - Path Finding in Weighted Graphs (Without Negative Weights):
    Example: Finding all possible paths between two nodes.
    Reason: DFS explores each path deeply before moving to another path, which is useful when the path or sequence matters.

    - Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs:
    Example: Detecting cycles in a directed graph (e.g., dependency graph).
    Reason: DFS can keep track of the recursion stack to detect back edges, which indicate cycles.

    - Topological Sorting:
    Example: Determining the order of tasks given their dependencies.
    Reason: DFS can be used to perform topological sorting by exploring each vertex and storing it in a stack according to its finishing time.

    - Strongly Connected Components:
    Example: Finding SCCs in a directed graph.
    Reason: Algorithms like Kosaraju’s and Tarjan’s use DFS to find SCCs by exploring depth-first and utilizing the recursion stack or a stack of finishing times.

    - Backtracking Problems:
    Example: Solving puzzles like Sudoku, N-Queens, or generating permutations and combinations.
    Reason: DFS explores one potential solution path fully before backtracking to explore another, making it suitable for backtracking.

    - Tree Traversals:
    Example: Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals of a binary tree.
    Reason: DFS naturally aligns with recursive tree traversal patterns.

    - Checking for Reachability:
    Example: Determining if there is a path between two nodes.
    Reason: DFS can be used to determine if a node can reach another node in the graph.


[SUMMARY]:
    - Use BFS: When the problem involves finding the shortest path, exploring levels of a graph, or dealing with unweighted graphs.
    - Use DFS: When the problem requires exploring all possibilities, involves recursion (e.g., tree traversals), or deals with pathfinding in weighted graphs where path sequence matters.
    - Choosing between BFS and DFS often depends on whether you're prioritizing depth exploration or breadth exploration and whether you need to find the shortest path or explore all possible solutions.
